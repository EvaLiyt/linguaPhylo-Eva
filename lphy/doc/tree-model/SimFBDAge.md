SimFBDAge distribution
======================
SimFBDAge(Number **lambda**, Number **mu**, Double **frac**, Number **psi**, Number **originAge**)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A tree of extant species and those sampled through time, which is conceptually embedded in a full species tree produced by a speciation-extinction (birth-death) branching process.<br>Conditioned on origin age.

### Parameters

- Number **lambda** - per-lineage birth rate.
- Number **mu** - per-lineage death rate.
- Double **frac** - fraction of extant taxa sampled.
- Number **psi** - per-lineage sampling-through-time rate.
- Number **originAge** - the age of the origin.

### Return type

- TimeTree
