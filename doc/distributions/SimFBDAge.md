SimFBDAge distribution
======================
SimFBDAge(Object **lambda**, Object **mu**, Object **frac**, Object **psi**, Object **originAge**)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A tree of extant species and those sampled through time, which is conceptually embedded in a full species tree produced by a speciation-extinction (birth-death) branching process.<br>Conditioned on origin age.

### Parameters

- Object **lambda** - per-lineage birth rate.
- Object **mu** - per-lineage death rate.
- Object **frac** - fraction of extant taxa sampled.
- Object **psi** - per-lineage sampling-through-time rate.
- Object **originAge** - the age of the origin.

### Return type

- Object
